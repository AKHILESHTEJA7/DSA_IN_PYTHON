"""
O(1) - Constant Time: The execution time remains constant regardless of the input size.
O(log n) - Logarithmic Time: The execution time grows logarithmically with the input size.
O(n) - Linear Time: The execution time grows linearly with the input size.
O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time: The execution time grows in proportion to n times the logarithm of n.
O(n^2) - Quadratic Time: The execution time grows quadratically with the input size.
